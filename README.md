# Compiler-from-Java-to-MIPS
n this course, the students form groups and can choose to develop their own compiler projects in the areas of distributed systems, blockchains and cryptocurrencies, automatic program synthesis and programming languages. See the instructor homepage for example projects. The students can choose the following predefined and well-developed project. The project covers all the phases of the design and implementation of a modern compiler for object-oriented languages. The project is divided into four separate phases that can be done independently. The phases can be combined into a Java-to-MIPS compiler. All the required material including the test-case programs that are used for grading, ample description, implementation hints and documentation are available in this page. The goal of the course is to design and implement the main phases of a modern compiler. The project consists of four phases. In these phases, you will be converting a subset of the Java language called MiniJava to simpler languages and eventually to complete MIPS machine code. The phases can be combined into a MiniJava-to-MIPS compiler.
